# Eyes-of-Depth--Blockchain-illegal-transaction-activity-prediction-and-monitoring
This system collects various existing illegal transaction data, performs community analysis through complex networks based on the original transaction data, traces two- and three-layer networks, and models cryptocurrency transaction relationships using tracing algorithms, traceability algorithms, and traceability layer analysis.   Based on the modeling, feature extraction, analysis of temporal features and network features are performed on the data to build a dataset for predicting illegal trading behavior using machine learning models.  #TODO The system combines front and back-end, and the results can be visualized in the form of pictures for monitoring and viewing the analysis of current cryptocurrency trading behavior on the Web side.
